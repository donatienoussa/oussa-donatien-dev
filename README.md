# oussa-donatien-dev

This is my **personal developer portfolio**, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  
It showcases my skills, freelance services, and selected projects in **mobile development**, **AI**, **Web3**, and more.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, clone the repository and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install && yarn dev
# or
pnpm install && pnpm dev
